# Project Description:

The main goal is to build a fashion web scrapping application as a powerful resource to allow users to discover new hard to find websites or websites with a strong collective of independent designers specifically targeting products from these **independent designers**. Giving the user an app that groups these websites, designers and products in one easy to find place. Giving constant updates on new products they like from particular websites they choose to follow. As well alert users when new sites are added to the app. The user can share items they like anytime  throughout their social media platforms. As well see the items they've like on an engaging and beautifully built timeline. The app is meant to strongly focus on engaging users with designers products. learn more about a designers story/background and proliferate the sales of the designers products with features targeting around these notions, meaning less on the social aspect between **user to user** and more **user to designer**.
